READ ME INSTRUCTIONS
1) Open a new project on CodeBlocks
2) Name the project accordingly, specify the location where the project files and binaries needs to be
saved.
3) Right click on the project to add all the necessary files to the project.
Necessary files needed are
a. Project1_A04824992_BackwardChaining.h
b. Project1_ A04824992_BackwardChaining.cpp
c. Project1_ A04824992_ForwardChaining.h
d. Project1_ A04824992_ForwardChaining.cpp
e. Project1_ A04824992_Driver.cpp
f. Project1_ A04824992_Variable_List.txt
g. Project1_ A04824992_Clausevarlist.txt
h. Project1_ A04824992_Conclusion_list.txt
i. Project1_ A04824992_KnowledgeBaseBC.txt
j. Project1_ A04824992_ClausevarlistFC.txt
k. Project1_ A04824992_KnowledgeBaseFC.txt
l. Replace the default Driver.cpp file in the project with the Project1_ A04824992_Driver.cpp
4) Make sure all the text files reside in the same exact location as the .h and .cpp files.
5) Paste the copy of all the text files in the location where the project was created along with bin and
Debug folders to link files and retrieve information successfully to the project.
6) Build the project, ignore warnings and run Project1_A04824992_Driver.cpp
7) Project1_A04824992_Driver.cpp will link all the class files and call necessary functions in cpp.
8) Once there is a successful execution, The program will display several options to the medical technician
or clinical staff.
9) If the below is selected :
1. Identify the Disease and get the treatment.
a. It will prompt for a user to instantiate all the symptoms with input YES/NO
b. YES/NO can be referred from the Knowledge base, if a particular disorder do not have any value for
a symptom, please enter NO to instantiate.
c. Please refer to Knowledge Base to input exact symptoms to a particular disorder to verify the
output.
d. It will provide the correct diagnosis pertaining to the symptoms entered by the user.
10) If the below option is selected :
2. Print the Knowledge Base, Variable List, Clause Variable List and Conclusion List for Backward
Chaining.
a. This will display all the contents stored in the above array values.
11) Finally when the third option is selected as below :
3. Print the Knowledge Base and Clause Variable List for Forward Chaining.
a. This option will display the Knowledge base rules and the array value assigned.
